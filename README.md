# D3.js Trees and Graphs representations
The simple representation of trees and graphs in Javascript using D3.
This project contains:
1. [graph.html](graph.html) - The map of Saint-Petersburb metro (some staytions are excluded) that works on Dijkstra algorythom to count the shortest in time route between the start and the target stations.
2. [binary_tree.html](binary_tree.html) - Simple representation of Binary search tree that is built on a given (or random) sequence of numbers. The eponymous JS script also contains methods to check if the resulting BST is balanced or not, what is its height and so on.
